[00:19.62] Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
[00:27.92] I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
[00:36.98] This is never ending, we have been here before
[00:45.47] But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
[01:14.47] 
[00:53.64] Please, stay where you are
[00:57.86] Don't come any closer
[01:02.35] Don't try to change my mind
[01:06.74] I'm being cruel to be kind
[01:19.74] 
[01:11.20] I can't love you in the dark
[01:19.46] It feels like we're oceans apart
[01:28.61] There is so much space between us
[01:32.77] Baby, we're already defeated
[01:37.13] Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[01:41.58] Everything changed me
[01:52.08] 
[01:46.91] You have given me something that I can't live without
[01:55.44] You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
[02:04.02] But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
[02:12.61] The longer we ignore it, all the more that we will fight
[02:40.61] 
[02:20.66] Please, don't fall apart
[02:25.26] I can't face your breaking heart
[02:29.55] I'm trying to be brave
[02:34.01] Stop asking me to stay
[02:45.01] 
[02:38.27] I can't love you in the dark
[02:46.62] It feels like we're oceans apart
[02:55.99] There is so much space between us
[03:00.13] Baby, we're already defeated
[03:04.42] Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[03:08.87] Everything changed me
[03:19.37] 
[03:13.59] We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing
[03:17.70] Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean
[03:22.11] It is the world to me that you are in my life
[03:26.62] But I want to live and not just survive
[03:46.12] 
[03:51.92] That's why I can't love you in the dark
[04:01.00] It feels like we're oceans apart
[04:10.29] There is so much space between us
[04:14.16] Baby, we're already defeated
[04:19.36] 'Cause, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[04:23.25] Everything changed me
[04:33.75] 
[04:28.02] And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me
